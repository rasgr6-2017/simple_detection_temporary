Tips for solving simple detection problem

1. try color based blob detection.
  1.1 HSV color space is more robust to illumination change, but not totally immune to it. So try to use some filter or 
      morphlogy method to make the color segmentation of object more like a blob.
  1.2 Use color threshold, maybe on HSV color space to get segmentation of specific color range, which include certain 
      type of object. Turn this into gray image, maybe better than gray image directly transformed from HSV or RGB image.
2. try other space-color based segmentation method like meanshift. Though it might be slow but it can have better color blob.
